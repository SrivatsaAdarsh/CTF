We are at the end of the world, which is known as Kali Yuga, and it's high time the curse be lifted as a sinful world takes over. Is there no end to this bloodshed? Deepika Padukone is the one who has to give birth to Kalki (the final embodiment of God) to save the world, and Amitabh Bachchan is the one who saves her and takes her to Sambala, a village where Amitabh hides Deepika. PRABHAS RAJU, without realizing that he is the good guy and hero of the entire story, tries to catch Deepika to claim a bounty. In the process, he realizes he is the hero and that he must get hold of Deepika to save the world. After a long search, he finds a ciphertext 18 20 20 2A 28 2D  that can help him get into Sambala to save the world. Can you decrypt the ciphertext and help Prabhas reach Sambala?
